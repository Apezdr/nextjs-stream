## Progress

- **What works:**
    - The basic Next.js application structure is set up.
    - The project can be run in development mode.
    - The project has configurations for ESLint and image optimization.
    - Multi-server sync system implemented with:
        - Field-level availability tracking
        - Priority-based synchronization
        - Two-phase sync process (gather/finalize)
        - Concurrent data collection
        - Granular sync operations for:
            - Movies (metadata, captions, video info)
            - TV Shows (show/season/episode data)
            - Media assets (posters, backdrops, thumbnails)
        - Error handling and progress tracking
        - Webhook support
        - Subscriber pattern for concurrent syncs

- **What's left to build:**
    - Implement additional media streaming functionality.
    - Integrate with more third-party libraries and APIs for media streaming and metadata retrieval.
    - Implement user authentication and authorization.
    - Implement the admin panel for managing users and media content.
    - Implement remaining front end components.
    - Potential sync system improvements:
        - Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
        - More granular progress reporting
        - Additional webhook integrations
        - Performance optimizations for large datasets
        - Expanded field-level availability tracking

- **Progress status:** 
    - Core application structure complete
    - Multi-server sync system operational
    - Additional features and optimizations pending
