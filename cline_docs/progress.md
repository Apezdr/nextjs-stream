## Progress

- **What works:**
    - The basic Next.js application structure is set up.
    - The project can be run in development mode.
    - The project has configurations for ESLint and image optimization.
    - Multi-server sync system implemented with:
        - Field-level availability tracking
        - Priority-based synchronization
        - Two-phase sync process (gather/finalize)
        - Concurrent data collection
        - Granular sync operations for:
            - Movies (metadata, captions, video info, mediaQuality)
            - TV Shows (show/season/episode data)
            - Media assets (posters, backdrops, thumbnails)
        - Error handling and progress tracking
        - Webhook support
        - Subscriber pattern for concurrent syncs
        - Robust priority enforcement to prevent lower priority servers from overwriting data
        - Improved null/undefined value handling to maintain data integrity
        - Selective update pattern for captions and posters to prevent update loops between servers
        - Preservation of data from multiple servers during sync operations
        - Source-aware updates that respect data ownership across servers

- **What's left to build:**
    - Implement additional media streaming functionality.
    - Integrate with more third-party libraries and APIs for media streaming and metadata retrieval.
    - Implement user authentication and authorization.
    - Implement the admin panel for managing users and media content.
    - Implement remaining front end components.
    - Potential sync system improvements:
        - Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
        - More granular progress reporting
        - Additional webhook integrations
        - Performance optimizations for large datasets
        - Expanded field-level availability tracking
        - Additional mediaQuality fields and format detection
        - Comprehensive testing of priority-based field selection
        - Apply selective update pattern to other sync modules (backdrops, thumbnails, etc.)
        - Add more granular logging to track which specific data is being updated and from which servers
        - Implement source tracking for all media assets to improve ownership management

- **Progress status:** 
    - Core application structure complete
    - Multi-server sync system operational with improved data integrity
    - Priority-based field selection enhanced to prevent data corruption
    - Selective update pattern implemented for captions and posters to prevent update loops
    - Additional features and optimizations pending
